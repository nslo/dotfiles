2013-03-24 21:31:58	shaladdle	Hey I'm getting this when I try to use std::list on gates machiens: ./a.out: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.15' not found (required by ./a.out)
2013-03-24 21:32:12	shaladdle	I tried it first in my master.cpp, and then I tried it again in a really dumb file, and that didn't work either
2013-03-24 21:32:37	shaladdle	like this:
2013-03-24 21:32:38	shaladdle	#include <iostream> #include <list>  int main() {     std::list<int> l;      l.push_front(5);      std::cout << l.back() << std::endl;      return 0; }
2013-03-24 21:32:40	shaladdle	oops
2013-03-24 21:32:43	shaladdle	that didn't format well :(
2013-03-24 21:32:59	shaladdle	#include <iostream>
2013-03-24 21:32:59	shaladdle	#include <iostream>
2013-03-24 21:33:05	shaladdle	eh forget that..
2013-03-24 21:33:53	shaladdle	I guess it looks like there's some library that g++ isn't seeing. If anyone's had this problem before or knows what's up let me know! Thanks
2013-03-24 21:44:27	sfackler	std::list is header only. That error could be a version mismatch between unix.andrew machines and ghc.andrew machines. Does the same thing happen on unix.andrew.cmu.edu?
2013-03-24 21:44:58	shaladdle	checking..
2013-03-24 21:45:41	shaladdle	yep, works on unix
2013-03-24 21:47:10	sfackler	I'm betting that it's libglog and/or libgflags.
2013-03-24 21:48:44	shaladdle	is there some work-around so it works on ghc?
2013-03-24 21:49:22	sfackler	compile local versions of glog and gflags, tweak the makefile to look at your version of pkg-config
2013-03-24 21:49:38	sfackler	or post on piazza :P
2013-03-24 21:55:46	shaladdle	boo, ok
2013-03-24 21:56:15	shaladdle	when you said it was libglog/libgflags, what exactly do you mean? I see that unix.andrew has an earlier version of GCC
2013-03-24 21:56:26	shaladdle	but not sure what those libs have to do with it
2013-03-24 22:02:50	sfackler	The assignment uses libglog and libgflags, but those aren't installed on the Unix machines. The 418 course staff compiled them manually and put them in 418/public/lib. But, they were compiled on the unix.andrew machines, which use version 3.4.15 of libstdc++. libglog and libgflags need that version specifically to work. The GHC machines have a different (I think older) version of libstdc++ instead so the runtime linker dies
2013-03-24 22:10:15	shaladdle	But to get that error, I just have to make a really simple file that uses std::list (and *not* glog/gflags), and then do g++ simplelist.cpp (on ghc).. It seems totally unrelated to glog and gflags.
2013-03-24 22:10:52	sfackler	oh, that's weird
2013-03-24 22:10:58	sfackler	your environment may be totally screwed up
2013-03-24 22:11:09	sfackler	what does 'which g++' say?
2013-03-24 22:12:48	shaladdle	lwekjflkwe
2013-03-24 22:12:50	shaladdle	oh
2013-03-24 22:12:53	shaladdle	pasting doesn't work...
2013-03-24 22:13:00	shaladdle	 /usr/local/bin/g++
2013-03-24 22:13:02	shaladdle	no
2013-03-24 22:13:05	shaladdle	it thought I was typing a command
2013-03-24 22:13:30	shaladdle	anyways, that's what which says
2013-03-24 22:15:01	sfackler	woah
2013-03-24 22:15:04	sfackler	same thing happens to me
2013-03-24 22:15:46	sfackler	could be a bad upgrade
2013-03-24 22:16:25	shaladdle	that's silly
2013-03-24 22:20:02	fibonacci	you're silly
2013-03-24 22:20:42	sfackler	short term, adding -static-libstc++ to CXXFLAGS should fix it
2013-03-24 22:22:44	shaladdle	-static-libstc++ or -static-libstdc++
2013-03-24 22:22:50	shaladdle	?
2013-03-24 22:24:20	sfackler	-static-libstdc++
2013-03-24 22:24:56	shaladdle	okey
2013-03-24 22:26:54	shaladdle	awesome, the error seems to be gone
2013-03-24 22:26:56	shaladdle	thanks so much!

2013-05-13 16:16:42	areece	so yeah
2013-05-13 16:16:45	user123abc	so is the issue with the compiler?
2013-05-13 16:16:49	areece	I'm trying to write  amemory bandwidth profiler
2013-05-13 16:16:53	user123abc	or even indep. of that
2013-05-13 16:16:55	areece	open up nc
2013-05-13 16:16:59	areece	I'll send you source
2013-05-13 16:17:10	user123abc	I dont know what to do with nc
2013-05-13 16:17:16	areece	aw screw it
2013-05-13 16:17:16	areece	https://gist.github.com/awreece/5571138
2013-05-13 16:17:26	user123abc	do you know about vtune?
2013-05-13 16:17:29	areece	that code refuses to report meaningful values
2013-05-13 16:17:31	user123abc	they have a bandwidth profiler
2013-05-13 16:17:32	areece	nope
2013-05-13 16:17:35	areece	orly
2013-05-13 16:17:37	user123abc	you should check it out
2013-05-13 16:17:42	user123abc	so there are two ways to do profiling
2013-05-13 16:17:44	user123abc	1) sampling
2013-05-13 16:17:47	user123abc	2) hardware counters
2013-05-13 16:17:59	user123abc	sampling uses probability to reason about how much time everything was taking
2013-05-13 16:18:15	areece	you're missing
2013-05-13 16:18:15	user123abc	hardware counters directly count all sort of cpu events
2013-05-13 16:18:18	areece	3) manually do it
2013-05-13 16:18:19	user123abc	like the number of memory reads
2013-05-13 16:18:21	user123abc	lol
2013-05-13 16:18:25	areece	thats what I'm doing :P
2013-05-13 16:18:28	areece	look at my code?
2013-05-13 16:18:29	user123abc	fair enough
2013-05-13 16:18:37	areece	I fera I'm just missing somethign huge
2013-05-13 16:18:39	areece	https://gist.github.com/awreece/5571138
2013-05-13 16:19:11	user123abc	looking at it now
2013-05-13 16:20:16	areece	yeah
2013-05-13 16:20:18	areece	every time I run
2013-05-13 16:20:20	areece	I get like
2013-05-13 16:20:22	areece	5 GB/s
2013-05-13 16:21:25	areece	fyi
2013-05-13 16:21:31	areece	I updated it and added an assert
2013-05-13 16:21:45	user123abc	where?
2013-05-13 16:21:54	areece	line 35
2013-05-13 16:22:14	areece	lol
2013-05-13 16:22:19	areece	I inherited this code
2013-05-13 16:27:52	user123abc	hey, but if you're into this stuff, check out intel's optimization guide
2013-05-13 16:27:54	user123abc	it's REALLY good
2013-05-13 16:28:02	user123abc	it tells you about the relevant architecture
2013-05-13 16:28:22	user123abc	and says "here's what hardware counters you should look at in order to diagnose problem X"
2013-05-13 16:28:27	areece	hrm
2013-05-13 16:28:31	areece	I'll have to actually read that
2013-05-13 16:28:31	user123abc	perf --stat reads those counters
2013-05-13 16:28:37	areece	on linux
2013-05-13 16:28:39	areece	but yeah
2013-05-13 16:28:40	user123abc	but vtune has more knowledge
2013-05-13 16:28:43	user123abc	hahahahaha
2013-05-13 16:28:54	user123abc	it knows abouut all the counters
2013-05-13 16:28:58	user123abc	and makes summaries for you
2013-05-13 16:29:03	user123abc	its also slow as BALLS
