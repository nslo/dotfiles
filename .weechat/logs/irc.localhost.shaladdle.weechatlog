2013-03-13 14:15:29	shaladdle	hihi
2013-03-13 14:19:28	fibonacci	I haven't tried running it yet - in the past it installs fine but doesn't pick up my usb audio right away
2013-03-13 14:19:43	shaladdle	on the pi or on your machine?
2013-03-13 14:19:52	fibonacci	on my machine
2013-03-13 14:19:54	fibonacci	don't have a pi yet
2013-03-13 14:19:59	shaladdle	ah
2013-03-13 14:20:17	fibonacci	it would be sending the data to the network so it would be a little different
2013-03-13 14:20:20	fibonacci	unclear if it will work
2013-03-13 14:20:29	fibonacci	but worth a shot and if it doesn't i can mess with the pi
2013-03-13 14:20:34	shaladdle	yeah
2013-03-13 14:21:37	fibonacci	i feel like i've seen everything from 750 to 1000 listed
2013-03-13 14:21:57	shaladdle	ohh
2013-03-13 14:21:58	shaladdle	where?
2013-03-13 14:22:06	fibonacci	uhhhh hither and thither
2013-03-13 14:22:37	fibonacci	http://lifehacker.com/5976912/a-beginners-guide-to-diying-with-the-raspberry-pi
2013-03-13 14:22:39	fibonacci	that says 700
2013-03-13 14:22:52	fibonacci	but then you have to have a little extra for the dongle right?
2013-03-13 14:24:01	shaladdle	hard to tell where that number comes from
2013-03-13 14:24:13	shaladdle	you should be able to look at the edimax and see watts or current
2013-03-13 14:25:37	shaladdle	like that number could be with or without peripherals
2013-03-13 14:26:53	shaladdle	Will you email Veloso about Creates? I did and she didn't respond...
2013-03-13 14:27:00	shaladdle	Also did she say she would send us papers?
2013-03-13 14:28:18	fibonacci	i don't recall her saying that...she might have suggested we look some up ourselves
2013-03-13 14:28:30	fibonacci	i'll email her
2013-03-13 14:28:38	shaladdle	cool
2013-03-13 14:28:48	fibonacci	we might have to write our proposal without having the platform solidified
2013-03-13 14:29:17	fibonacci	are you in town?
2013-03-13 14:29:26	shaladdle	no
2013-03-13 14:29:28	shaladdle	I won't be :|
2013-03-13 14:29:34	shaladdle	but I have plenty of time here
2013-03-13 14:29:43	shaladdle	the person I'm staying with has to be in class/rehearsal all day
2013-03-13 14:29:48	shaladdle	so I can skype or whatever
2013-03-13 14:29:51	shaladdle	I'm looking for papers right now
2013-03-13 14:29:55	fibonacci	no biggie
2013-03-13 14:29:57	shaladdle	https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/38326/Cunningham10iros.pdf
2013-03-13 14:30:01	shaladdle	http://web.mit.edu/16.412j/www/html/readings/Eliazar%2BParr-ijcai-03.pdf
2013-03-13 14:38:10	fibonacci	i've been meaning to read the material you sent me before as well
2013-03-13 14:38:16	fibonacci	i've just been pretty amazingly lazy this week
2013-03-13 14:38:20	shaladdle	yes
2013-03-13 14:38:24	shaladdle	that is the purpose of this week :)
2013-03-13 14:38:42	shaladdle	unfortunately 780 is being lame about that
2013-03-13 14:39:41	fibonacci	yeah, and i'd really like to make progress on my animation assignment too
2013-03-13 14:39:57	fibonacci	to avoid the same '3 hw in 2 weeks' deal
2013-03-13 14:40:11	shaladdle	yes that is not something I would like to repeat either
2013-03-13 14:40:20	fibonacci	but....code geass...
2013-03-13 14:40:27	shaladdle	bwahahaha
2013-03-13 14:40:31	shaladdle	no reason you can't do both :P
2013-03-13 14:40:35	shaladdle	still have a bunch of days of break
2013-03-13 14:40:38	shaladdle	also watch with bhaskar!
2013-03-13 14:41:03	fibonacci	he's like 9 eps behind me now
2013-03-13 14:41:11	shaladdle	who's fault is that lol?
2013-03-13 14:41:14	shaladdle	tell him to catch up!
2013-03-13 14:41:15	fibonacci	haha his
2013-03-13 14:41:30	fibonacci	maybe we can just decide to do season 2 in a marathon
2013-03-13 14:43:29	shaladdle	where are you in the series, what's happening?
2013-03-13 14:44:49	fibonacci	lelouch just found out suzaku is the pilot of the white robot when they rescued toudou
2013-03-13 14:45:17	fibonacci	this series has a lot of complexity, i love it
2013-03-13 14:45:22	shaladdle	hehe
2013-03-13 14:45:29	shaladdle	lelouch is such a badass
2013-03-13 14:45:42	fibonacci	it's like evangelion + gurren lagann
2013-03-13 14:46:11	shaladdle	Hehe kind of. The main character is too evil for it to be too much like either imo
2013-03-13 14:46:37	fibonacci	that's true...gotta love that
2013-03-13 14:49:16	fibonacci	just finished 17
2013-03-13 14:50:35	shaladdle	hehe almost done with first season
2013-03-13 14:52:06	fibonacci	did you ever buy IEMs?
2013-03-13 14:52:11	fibonacci	i need new ones
2013-03-13 14:52:19	shaladdle	like the ones I showed you"?
2013-03-13 14:52:52	fibonacci	oh
2013-03-13 14:52:58	fibonacci	right you did
2013-03-13 14:53:04	fibonacci	which were those?
2013-03-13 14:53:13	shaladdle	they were klipsch
2013-03-13 14:53:37	shaladdle	mine were marketed as being "gamer" ones, but they were $50 klipsch, and I assume much like these
2013-03-13 14:53:37	shaladdle	http://www.amazon.com/Klipsch-IMAGE-S4-Noise-Isolating-Headphones/dp/B001V9LPT4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1363200846&sr=8-1&keywords=klipsch
2013-03-13 14:53:57	fibonacci	do you like them?
2013-03-13 14:54:16	shaladdle	I like them, but I also feel like I'm not as good a judge as you or Bhaskar :P
2013-03-13 14:54:24	shaladdle	You seemed to think they sounded pretty decent
2013-03-13 14:54:35	fibonacci	i vaguely remember this
2013-03-13 14:54:39	fibonacci	wonder how tired i was
2013-03-13 14:54:46	shaladdle	haha
2013-03-13 14:54:50	shaladdle	there was a lot of tired
2013-03-13 14:55:42	fibonacci	i reviewed the first couple minutes of the last lecture in 418 - kayvon said the midsemester grades would count the midterm but probably not project 3
2013-03-13 14:56:01	shaladdle	oehhwhh
2013-03-13 14:56:06	fibonacci	he must have curved the midterm pretty ridiculously
2013-03-13 14:56:09	shaladdle	how is your grade?
2013-03-13 14:56:09	shaladdle	hah
2013-03-13 14:56:16	fibonacci	i have an A
2013-03-13 14:56:20	shaladdle	wow nice!
2013-03-13 14:56:23	shaladdle	I got an A-
2013-03-13 14:56:42	shaladdle	I wonder if participation grades are included or something
2013-03-13 14:56:43	fibonacci	i would have sworn that i failed the midterm outright though
2013-03-13 14:56:46	fibonacci	yeah maybe
2013-03-13 14:56:57	shaladdle	I could have done the same
2013-03-13 14:56:58	fibonacci	not sure my grade is accurate honestly
2013-03-13 14:57:01	shaladdle	hehe
2013-03-13 14:57:19	fibonacci	we'll still get docked a bit for hw 3 though probably =/
2013-03-13 14:57:27	shaladdle	yeah
2013-03-13 14:57:30	shaladdle	I think it's recoverable though
2013-03-13 14:57:38	fibonacci	hopefully
2013-03-13 14:57:43	fibonacci	have to nail the next one
2013-03-13 14:59:20	shaladdle	yeah
