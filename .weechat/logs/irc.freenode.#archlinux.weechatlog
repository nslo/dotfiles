2013-05-06 20:09:20	BonSequitur	It also has a really puny Atom CPU.
2013-05-06 20:09:47	BonSequitur	So rebuilding it with ‘aggressive’ optimizations produces a fairly noticeable performance gain with things like full-screen video.
2013-05-06 20:09:56	bri-an	BonSequitur: freebsd has a ports system plus a binary package system. you could install everything as binaries, or everything from source, or a combination

The lower right is what I get when I try to use any XFT font I have installed. All others use the terminus font and render fine http://i.imgur.com/w1R8eMh.jpg

2013-05-07 00:38:28	Kopkins	kylesnav, unless you set it up a special way, the only the the VM (arch) will see is a ethernet connection. The install disk is set up to automatically start a wired connection if it can. You should be able to run dhcpcd (as root) and get a connection from your VM. Also try the beginners guide for setting up connections after you installed. If you use a desktop environment, network managers can help automatically connect too.

2013-05-07 18:59:10	Aardwolf	Hi... after fully switching to systemd, network did not work. The command I normally use to fix that, "/etc/rc.d/network restart", said amazingly "bash: /etc/rc.d/network: No such file or directory". And then thanks to the internet on my phone I could find that now it is instead: "systemctl restart dhcpcd@eth0".
2013-05-07 18:59:21	Aardwolf	So, did EVERYTHING I know about linux change now? What else changed? Thanks

2013-05-07 22:47:12	weirddan455	Firefishe, I thought I explained it pretty clearly before.  When you ran pacman -Syu, the libpng you had installed from the repos was updated from libpng15 to libpng16.  E17 was compiled against libpng15, which isn't on your system anymore so it fails.  You just need to recompile the E17 package and all will be better.
2013-05-07 22:47:16	Scimmia	Firefishe, unless you have ewebkit installed, then yes, efl-git is the culprit

2013-05-07 23:30:57	weirddan455	waltercool, Arch is the most bleeding edge distro I've ever seen.  Almost immediatly after upstream releases something, it goes to the [testing] repo then a couple weeks later it'll be in the main repo... also it has the best package manager IMO, and is more minimilistic than other distros (you only install what YOU want, nothing more)

2013-05-07 23:32:16	weirddan455	Difference is, I can have a full XFCE install from scratch in about an hour in Arch... Gentoo takes forever with all that compilation for little benefit and even less benefit if you're using 64 bit
2013-05-07 23:32:33	waltercool	weirddan455, but for example, I'm now using Arch on ARMv6 AKA Raspberry Pi... that doesn't make me be paired to x86 or x86-64

2013-05-07 23:42:01	Scimmia	Firefishe, versions of pacman before 4.1 had the date hardcoded as the pkgver. With 4.1 we are able to use meaningful versions, so the versioning scheme changed. 20130112 is greater than 1.7.99 as far as pacman is concerned, which is why it thinks it was a downgrade

2013-05-08 02:15:25	CPUnltd1	I'm under the impression that XDM is lighter, faster and more stable than SLiM... but the wiki does it no justice in the realm of configuration... someone I chatted on here with a couple of days ago pointed out that XDM configuring was pretty easy... wonder where that person is now.

2013-05-08 02:20:56	CPUnltd1	true, weirddan455, but transparency is supported, the background is really just as simple as pointing to a png (for the most part) and fonts are smooth... looking to get XDM there (as I've seen in screenshots online) and add the onscreen keyboard... but I'm pretty much in the dark at this point.  I know I needed a little help wrapping my head around SLiM years ago, but I've all but mastered it to this point.  The only exception is
2013-05-08 02:21:50	simon	weirddan455, yup. okay, so I did "modprobe e1000e" and it didn't let me ifconfig eth0 up, but then I rmmod; modprobe; and it worked!

2013-05-08 02:25:50	weirddan455	I suppose a login manager would be very helpful for a tablet but I'm on a desktop and like to keep it simple... this way if X breaks, I don't have to enter into recovery mode or anything, I just always boot to the CLI

I only use SLiM so I have something pretty for people to look at when they see me turn on my computer (also, when I do new installs, I have scripted pretty much the entire process and the reboot into SLiM is the confirmation that the install went through fine (at least as far as X and it's configuration goes)

2013-05-08 02:41:08	weirddan455	CPUnltd1, the only difference between systemd and rc.conf is how you tell something to start at bootup
2013-05-08 02:41:22	weirddan455	CPUnltd1, configuring backgrounds and stuff should all still be the same
2013-05-08 02:41:48	weirddan455	CPUnltd1, With systemd, telling something to start is even easier IMO... I already told you the command up a few lines

2013-05-09 00:38:04	wakIII	SgrA: to tell if you env is 64 vs 32 bit?
2013-05-09 00:38:15	SgrA	This program that I need uses uname to check it.
2013-05-09 00:38:21	wakIII	oh.....
2013-05-09 00:38:27	SgrA	And fails to run because it doesn't want to run on 64 bit env.
2013-05-09 00:38:31	wakIII	alias uname to something else....
2013-05-09 00:38:56	velcroshooz	Nuck: you upgraded gdk-pixbuf2, and it has been doing wierd shit the last couple of releases. best answer i can give you. this same stuff happened on the last update of it
2013-05-09 00:38:56	wakIII	just make it return output which makes the program run happily
2013-05-09 00:39:01	SgrA	Just did 'linux32 chroot /opt/arch32' and now 'uname -m' gives i686.

I booted up the latest ISO to reinstall and I am surprised (shocked really) that there isn't a menu driven installer anymore. I haven't used arch for about 2 years now. The guide on the wiki doesn't have commands for partitioning/formatting/mounting so I am a little los

2013-05-09 19:24:39	willbill	I did a pacman -Syu, rebooted and now I can't even startx (KDE)
